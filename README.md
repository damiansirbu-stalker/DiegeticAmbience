# AlifeAmbience: a curated, audible ambient soundscape for STALKER Anomaly

An ambient soundscape built from the original GSC games, the standalone builds that reworked them (an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build, an old-era build) and the major soundscape packs, with every file corrected to be audible at the distance the engine places it.
A measured build pipeline folds every file to mono, sets its distance and loudness from ffmpeg and Chromaprint measurements, collapses duplicates and covers every map in every weather state, while Lua scripts and X-Ray engine hooks cover what a file cannot carry.

[Releases](https://github.com/damiansirbu-stalker/AlifeAmbience/releases) | [Bugs, suggestions](https://github.com/damiansirbu-stalker/AlifeAmbience/issues)

Requires: Anomaly 1.5.3, modded exes (themrdemonized or AOEngine), [xlibs](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001), and a weather mod whose ambient states it covers (Atmospherics out of the box). Exact versions in [readme.txt](doc/readme.txt).
