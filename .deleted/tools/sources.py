"""Source registry for the DiegeticAmbience bed merge.

One declarative entry per pack. `MODS` derives from `SOURCES` preserving order (dedup is
order-sensitive). Sources are ALWAYS pulled locally by hand; the pipeline never downloads, so `url`
and `licence` are credit/provenance record only (doc/licensing.md holds the basis per source).

Licence values mirror doc/licensing.md:
  game       - GSC original-game audio, community-tolerated (vanilla, standalone builds)
  pd         - Public Domain, credit only
  cc         - Creative Commons, credit only
  permission - the author granted it for my S.T.A.L.K.E.R. mods (doc/licensing.md records each grant)
  pending    - not located / unconfirmed; do not ship until resolved
