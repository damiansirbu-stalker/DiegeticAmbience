"""DiegeticAmbience mastering mill: the hand-authored config is the source of truth; this tool
materializes, masters, reports, and proves what the config says. It never chooses content.

The config (sound_channels.ltx, ambient_channels/*, ambients/*) is authored by hand
(doc/architecture.md: the channel is the unit of curation). Content choices live in the config and in
sources.py (DISPOSITIONS, DEPLOY_EXTRA). The mill's stages:

  materialize  pull exactly the referenced files from the source packs into gamedata/sounds,
               delete deployed files nothing references (deployed set == referenced set)  -> manifest.json
  fmt          mechanical config guard: dedup pool tokens, normalize preset lines, strip refs to
               deleted channels/files, cap spawn distances, FAIL any pool line over LINE_CAP
  fold         stereo -> mono (re-encode) + resample off-rate to 44100                    -> fold_blobs
  level        crest-inverted min floor + loudness band, one crest+LUFS pass              -> level_cache
  fingerprint  acoustic-duplicate WARNING report (Chromaprint); the curator resolves      -> stdout
  dead         dead-audio report (content at/below DEAD_LUFS); the curator excludes       -> stdout
  verify       the gate ledger (closure + retention + density + veto + load rules, 18 gates) -> ledger.tsv
  audit        wired min/felt-far ratio + crushed share (acceptance report)               -> stdout
  stage NAME   materialize a source folder under sounds/stage/ for in-game audition
  unstage      remove the whole stage tree
  import [SRC] one-time config baseline from a source pack's own sound-routing config (explicit only,
               refuses over an existing config; default source: the Amplified spine)
  all          materialize -> fmt -> fold -> level -> fingerprint -> dead -> verify -> audit

Audibility is an ENGINE problem, not loudness: stereo plays 2D, min 1-2 is crushed by OpenAL, quiet
content stays quiet. Fixed by lossless blob edits keyed to an ear calibration: fold stereo->mono; a
crest-inverted min-distance floor; a base_volume loudness BAND to the ear-anchored -30/-36 floors and
-24/-28 ceilings. See doc/library/anomaly/internals/sound-source-and-emitter.md. Strike files
(DEPLOY_EXTRA, sounds/nature/) get the fold only: the engine overrides their attenuation range per
strike (thunderbolt.cpp:235), so blob distances do nothing there.

# ---- audibility: the engine facts behind the fold + the blob floors --------------------------------
# Two engine facts (doc/library/anomaly/internals/sound-source-and-emitter.md) make most of a merged
# ambient corpus INAUDIBLE at range even when the files sound fine at-ear:
#   1. A STEREO ogg force-plays 2D at-ear at full volume, escaping both distance rolloffs (":258-268").
#      Only MONO spatialises. So every stereo bed/one-shot plays in-head, ignoring placement.
#   2. Every 3D voice is attenuated TWICE - X-Ray's linear fade AND OpenAL's inverse model keyed on the
#      ogg blob's min_distance (":132-181"). min 1-2 (the unset ffmpeg-era default, ~84% of this corpus)
#      costs -26..-31 dB at a 25-50 m placement BEFORE the linear fade. base_volume can't rescue it.

FLOOR_MAX_FRAC = 0.8     # cap the min floor below blob max so a real fade band always survives.
DEFAULT_MAX    = 100.0   # blob max for a blob-less file (corpus median from the survey).

#   2. base_volume LOUDNESS floor: lift a file whose DELIVERED loudness at felt-far sits below the ear-
#      anchored floor. Partial (close FRAC of the deficit), capped (MAXBV + a far-gain cap that keeps far
#      smooth_volume below the engine 1.0 clamp so falloff survives). Never lowers, overshoots, or flattens.
